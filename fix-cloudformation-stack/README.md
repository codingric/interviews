# Fix CloudFormation stack 


The exiting team member has created a CloudFormation stack that doesn't seem right.

The application also contains a database of users. The business demands a 100% uptime of the application and it must be highly available and cost. 


* there are concerns with the cost of the infrastructure
* there appears to be issues with environmental portability
* there appears to be issues with resiliency


Please make recommendations on how to change the CloudFormation stack to meet the business objectives.
